# Github Desktop, Github Pages

GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with over 11.9 million repositories. Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed.

Gaining an understanding of its features opens to developers a new and liberating approach to source code management. The surest path to mastering Git is to immerse oneself in its utilities and operations, to experience it first-hand.

## Github Desktop

### Normal Git commands

Normally, to use Git and Github, we would need to use the _terminal_ on our computers to save our code in the cloud. Here's what it looks like:

Initializing a repository

```bash
git init
```

Cloning a repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wes-chen/build-a-website.git
```

Pulling the most recent changes from your repository

```bash
git pull
```

Committing some changes in your local machine

```bash
git commit
```

Pushing your changes to the **internet** (Github)

```bash
git push origin [branch-name]
```

### Github Desktop to the rescue!

Fortunately, you don't have to learn this terminal stuff until you get to college.

Github Desktop makes it easy for us to do all of these operations with the click of a few buttons!

Let's try to pull our repository from last week, edit some files, commit our changes, then push it back to Github!

If you weren't here last week, no worries! [Here](https://github.com/wes-chen/build-a-website/tree/master/lesson-01) is last week's lesson. Please [create a Github account](https://github.com/join) and follow [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to make your very first repository!
