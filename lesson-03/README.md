### Anatomy
Every HTML element is comprised of:
- Opening tag: the first HTML tag that contains the element name, surrounded by ` < ` and ` > `.
- Content: the information contained betwen the opening and closing tags.
- Closing tag: the second HTML tag that contains the element name, surrounded by ` </ ` and `>`.

**`<p> Hello World! </p>`**
`p` stands for "paragraph" and will be your bread and butter element.
