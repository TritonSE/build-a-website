  <h1>Welcome! This is an h1 tag.</h1>
  <h2>This is an h2 tag.</h2>
  <h3>This is an h3 tag. You can keep going smaller and smaller by increasing the number in your &lt;h#&gt; tag. The maximum you can go is 6. </h3>
  <h4>This is h4.</h4>
  <h5>This is h5!</h5>
  <h6>this is h6...</h6>
  <h7>I've tried using h7, but it doesn't work!</h7>
  <p>Header 7 is the same as p.</p>
  <p>This is a really long paragraph. You can also put tags inside of tags, like an &lt;a&gt; (anchor) tag. The purpose of it is to link to some outside website, <a href="https://wes-chen.github.io">like this one</a>! Most of the time, you will use
    &lt;p&gt; tags for your main text. You can even add breaks by using the &lt;br /&gt; tag, like so. This sentence <br /> is broken. <br /> <br /> This sentence has been separated twice by the text above it with two &lt;br /&gt; tags.</p>
  <p> I've finally started a new &lt;p&gt; section. There are also things like <b>bolding with the &lt;b&gt; tag</b> or <u>underlining with the &lt;u&gt; tag</u>. I can even <i>italicize with the &lt;i&gt; tag</i>!</p>
  <button>This is a button. In a few weeks, we will learn how to make our button do things when it is clicked.</button>
  <p>I can attach images to my website with the &lt;img&gt; tag, like below!</p>

  <p>I can make tables</p>
  <p>I can make lists</p>
