# Bootstrap

## What are we going to learn about today?

Today we will be learning about Bootstrap, and how to incorporate it into our own website.

## What is Bootstrap?

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a popular front-end component library that makes life a lot easier for people who want to make websites. It is a framework, and it can help you in the following ways ([source](https://www.taniarascia.com/what-is-bootstrap-and-how-do-i-use-it/)):

-   Prevent repetition between projects
-   Utilize responsive design to allow your website to adapt to various screen sizes - mobile, desktop, and everything in between
-   Add consistency to design and code between projects and between developers
-   Quickly and easily prototype new designs
-   Ensure cross-browser compatibility

It is a lot easier to use Bootstrap's components to build a website rather than have to write all the CSS of your website yourself.

Bootstrap's [Get Started Page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) seems a little daunting already, but we'll only be focusing on using their prebuilt components that don't require any JavaScript.

## Core Concepts

### The Grid

[The grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/examples/grid/) is one of the most crucial concepts in using Bootstrap. Basically, you can divide a row into 12 "subunits" that you can combine to divide things evenly. You can divide your row in half, or in thirds, or in quarters with ease.

### Using Bootstrap components

Basically, we will use classnames to call our bootstrap components very easily.
