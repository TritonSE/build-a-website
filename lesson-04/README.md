# CSS Basics

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed, and after we create the skeleton for our website using HTML, we write CSS code to make it beautiful. 

Without good CSS code the website may look weird.

## CSS: Basics
### Style elements
Just like html code, like `<h1>title</h1>`, our CSS code is also contained inside a opening tag and a closing tag.

`<style> ...any CSS code you want to write </style>`

Typically, we put our `<style>...</style>` element inside of the `<head></head>` element. By convention, we put anything we want to display like text, paragraphs, and images in the `<body></body>` tag, and we put `<style></style>` in the `<head></head>` element.
