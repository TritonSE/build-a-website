## Syllabus

This is a program that will teach you how to create your own website.

The first two lessons will cover the essentials with Git, Github, Github Desktop, and Github Pages.

The next four lessons will cover basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and how to host static resources. That is all you will need to create your website.

The final two lessons involve a challenge to make your own professional website and how you can use Github Pages to host other projects you may have.

### Lesson Plan

1.  [Welcome, Setup, Github Accounts](lesson-01)
2.  [Github Desktop, Github Pages](lesson-02)
3.  [HTML Basics](lesson-03)
4.  [CSS Styling](lesson-04)
5.  [Add Bootstrap](lesson-05)
6.  [Add Pages and Host Static Files](lesson-06)

By the end of this program, you will have a working website that you can proudly show off to your friends and family.
